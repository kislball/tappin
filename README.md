### Features
* Easy to use - Tappin does not include any complex OOP or SOLID principles. Tappin fully relies on functions.
* Dependency Injection - DI is a powerful paradigm. Most powerful frameworks use DI as their core principle.
* Extensible - Only Tappin's core is non-replacable, everything else can be easily replaced, thanks to Tappin's modularity principle.

### Getting started
