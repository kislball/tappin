ðŸ¦– Powerful application framework for Deno.

### Features

- Easy to use - Tappin does not include any complex OOP or SOLID principles.
  Tappin fully relies on functions.
- Dependency Injection - DI is a powerful paradigm. Most powerful frameworks use
  DI as their core principle.
- Extensible - Only Tappin's core is non-replacable, everything else can be
  easily replaced, thanks to Tappin's modularity principle.

### Getting started

Tappin comes with a simple CLI. Create a new project in working directory using
this command:
